# Half-Hearted Bridge Points Drill

This web app was created after learning as little as possible
about the [leptos](https://book.leptos.dev/view/06_control_flow.html)
web framework.

There is a live version online here:

[Bridge Points Drill](https://ecashin.github.io/brpts/)

## Running Locally

## About Half-Heartedness

I think leptos looks great so far, but right now I'm more interested in using this app
than making a leptos app that is conventional and that looks nice.
Calling this web app "half hearted" is my way of acknowledging
that I have a lot to learn about leptos but haven't tried learning it yet.
